# Anolis Documentation

Minimal living documentation for Anolis Core.

## Contents

- [concept.md](concept.md) - What Anolis is and why it exists
- [architecture.md](architecture.md) - System design and component relationships
- [getting-started.md](getting-started.md) - Build and run instructions
- [providers.md](providers.md) - Provider protocol and development

Keep docs short. Update as system evolves.
